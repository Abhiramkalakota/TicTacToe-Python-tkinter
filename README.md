# Tic Tac Toe â€“ Python Tkinter App

## ðŸ“Œ About

This project is a two-player Tic Tac Toe game where players take turns placing Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner or a tie after each move and displays the result.

I followed a [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/Dx7pQV0ZTso) to build this project and learn the basics of creating desktop applications with Tkinter.
